        <h1 class="a">basketball</h1>
        <p>a game played between two teams of five players in which goals are scored by throwing a ball through a netted
            hoop fixed at each end of the court.
            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a
            rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24
            cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048
            m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through
            their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is
            worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is
            given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins,
            but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated

        <h2 class="b">Football</h2>
        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
            Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word
            is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada,
            South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football;
            Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football);
            International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of
            football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".</p>

        <h3 class="c">Golf</h3>
        <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a
            course in as few strokes as possible.

            Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the
            varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically have either 9
            or 18 holes, regions of terrain that each contain a cup, the hole that receives the ball. Each hole on a
            course has a teeing ground for the hole's first stroke, and a putting green containing the cup. There are
            several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall grass),
            and various hazards that may be water, rocks, or sand-filled bunkers. Each hole on a course is unique in its
            specific layout. Many golf courses are designed to resemble their native landscape, such as along a sea
            coast (where the course is called a links), within a forest, among rolling hills, or part of a desert.</p>
